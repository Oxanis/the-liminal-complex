		<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
		<p>
			The <em>Complex Research and Mapping Project (C.R.M.P for short)</em> is a group dedicated to exploring, researching, mapping, and then cataloguing everything about <em>The Complex</em> onto a <a href=/><em>Wiki</em></a> page for everyone to have access
			to. Although primarily a research team, it is also a fully functioning society, with bases across many levels, the most famous of which being <em>Main Outpost,</em> which can be found in <a href=/levels/2><em>Level 2.</em></a> The project openly
			welcomes new members as long as you are willing to take up a job position.
		</p><p>
			Jobs at the <em>C.R.M.P</em> can include exploring new levels, rescue missions, writeup work for the <a href=/><em>Wiki,</em></a> entity extermination, suply runs, team managers and more. The management structure has Team managers oversaw by a layer of
			primary managers, who are then managed by region managers for each territory, who are appointed by five executives who are voted for democratically by <em>all C.R.M.P members</em> every 6 months. 
		</p><p>
			The <em>C.R.M.P</em> has faced criticism by some for creating bias wiki pages that promote its own ideologies further. This is untrue and there are no recorded cases of this on the wiki. Their aim is to be as informational and factual as humanly possible,
			to which they have thus far proven their expertise in.
