			<em>Level 2</em> takes the form of an expansive indoor play area with sparse lighting and white concrete walls absent of windows. Though large, the level is not infinite and is estimated to have an area of approximately 2.5kmÂ². The floor is composed of
			various sections coloured concrete, with no signs of damage. Any lights in the level break when tampered with and do not seem to have an electrical connection. In addition, a plumbing system does not seem to be present within the level either. Attempts
			to break out of the level have proven fruitful, revealing the level takes place in an infinite white void, and the building does not seem to be suspended by anything, although gravity for structures made by humans certainly applies.
		</p><p>
			The structure of the play areas themselves is often confusing,
		</p><p>
			Throughout the level is plain baggage in many different forms such as plastic bags, suitcases, or backpacks. These bags have no names or brands attached to them and the designs are either plain or jumbled and abstract. (talk ab resources idk)
