			<em>Level 2</em> takes the form of an expansive indoor play area with sparse lighting and white concrete walls absent of windows. Though large, the level is not infinite and is estimated to have an area of approximately 80km². The floor is composed
			of various sections coloured concrete, with no signs of damage. Any lights in the level break when tampered with and do not seem to have an electrical connection. In addition, a plumbing system does not seem to be present within the level either.
			Attempts to break out of the level have proven fruitful, revealing the level takes place in an infinite white void, and the building does not seem to be suspended by anything, although gravity for structures made by humans certainly applies.
		</p><p>
			The structure of the play areas themselves is often confusing, the layout containing common structures found in a typical soft play but in a completely nonsensical layout, including hallways leading to nothing, maze-like areas that humans do not
			perceive as such at a first glance, unfriendly topology or drops into the void. The level also appears to actively amplify confusion and fear whilst in these areas, and is a minor sanity hazard, so it is recommended to avoid these areas if possible,
			and if you find yourself in one, to <em>stay calm</em> and map out the area until you find an exit.
		</p><p>
			Throughout the level is plain baggage in many different forms such as plastic bags, suitcases, or backpacks. These bags have no names or brands attached to them and the designs are either plain or jumbled and abstract. These bags appear and disappear
			temperamentally, with no one able to notice them do so. Inside the bags are resources that when taken out of the baggage will not disappear, being the source that makes <em>Level 2</em> near self-sustaining, although bases still often must go on
			resource expeditions.

		<h3>COMMUNITIES</h3>
		<p>
			Because of how early in <em>The Complex</em> and how easily accessible from many levels <em>Level 2</em> is, along with its rich resources and sparse hazards, <em>Level 2</em> is one of the most lived-in levels of <em>The Complex,</em>
			with one of the richest and most complex histories. The <em>C.R.M.P</em> attempts to be neutral, so no ideologies will be favoured in this article.
		</p>
		<h3>C.R.M.P Main Outpost</h3>
		<p>
			The main offices of the <em>C.R.M.P,</em> placed in <em>Level 2</em> for its resources and convenient location, as well as already existing infrastructure constructed by others to use networks and electricity, it covers a large area of 8km², it offers
			hospitality to any visitors, as well as offers places to live as long as you take up a <em>C.R.M.P</em> job position. Its policies on trade are inherited from the greater <em>C.R.M.P's</em> policies, which can be viewed on its wiki page.
		</p>
		<h3>Democratic Republic Of Level 2</h3>
		<p>
			The <em>Democratic Republic Of Level 2 (DR2 for short)</em> is a nation covering 34km² of <em>Level 2</em> that is one of the most economically active nations in <em>The Complex.</em> Although starting in <em>Level 2</em> and named for it, the nation
			has many enclaves and outposts in other levels. The nation had a relatively militaristic past, being controlled by a dictatorship, however after the <em>8-day revolution,</em> the government was overthrown and a democratic system of a council updating
			every 2 years was put into place. Anyone can move into the <em>DR2,</em> however citizenship and voting rights aren't granted until you have completed 5 years of work. More details can be found on its wiki entry.
		</p>
		<h3>Avalon Empire</h3>
		<p>
			A 9km² territory of the <em>Avalon Empire.</em> as is typical with the empire, if you have not applied for citizenship then you are not allowed inside. The borders are constantly changing due to Avalon's aggressive and unstable foreign policy.
			They have not been allowed to expand into new unclaimed territory after the <em>forever unclaimed lands act of 2001,</em> however have had many border disputes with the <em>DR2</em>
			New wanderers who are not an Avalic citizen will be asked to leave within one week of their arrival. The territory has an advanced public transport system to take you to the border if you want to stay in <em>Level 2.</em> It is recommended to stay away
			from this territory as Avalon's border policy is strict. This territory is largely sparsely populated but at the heart of it is the <em>Level 2 Avalic Trade Hub,</em> a city that primarily offers services, but will also buy goods if you are
			a merchant wishing to sell.
		</p>
		<h3>The Great City Of Level 2</h3>
		<p>
			<em>The Complex's</em> largest city and trade hub, <em>The Great City</em> is built in an area containing many entrances to the level, and has been completely transformed from the original play area with soft-play areas demolished and refurbished
			infrastructure to create the most convenient travel, trade and social hub of <em>The Complex.</em> The extent of the city in modern day covers 28km², and the city itself is managed by a council appointed by the <em>C.R.M.P, DR2,</em> and
			other powers. The laws allow a mostly free market, though policies do prevent scams and certain dangerous substances being sold, as well as requiring permits for certain products. The permanent population of the city is not too great, only ~9000 people,
			as most wanderers in the city are temporarily staying, going to socialise or buying and selling goods/services. Due to heavy supervision from police, the city's crime rates are very low, and thus given the welcoming nature, this city is cited as the
			safest area of <em>Level 2.</em>
