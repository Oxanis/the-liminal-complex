			<em>Level 1</em> takes the form of infinite fields with the occasional tree and hedge row. The level is mostly flat, and the grass is mostly green but has been reported to sometimes be yellow, and even more rearely, other colors such as pink, blue or red.
			The sky is a contant blue with some clouds, though the clouds are seemingly infinitely high in the air as they cannot be reached. The sky appears to be absent of the sun moon, and stars, but shadows still appear as if the sun was there and it was somewhat
			early in the day
