			<em>Level 1</em> takes the form of infinite fields with the occasional tree and hedge row. The level is mostly flat, and the grass is mostly green but has been reported to sometimes be yellow, and even more rearely, other colors such as pink, blue or red.
			The sky is a contant blue with some clouds, though the clouds are seemingly infinitely high in the air as they cannot be reached. The sky appears to be absent of the sun moon, and stars, but shadows still appear as if the sun was there and it was somewhat
			early in the day.
		</p><p>
			Throughout the level, there will rarely be a small concrete structure, often run-down and not ergonomically designed. Doors with graffiti are affixed to the structure and when opened, revealing a seperate sector of the level that should <em>never be entered
			unless necessary.</em> This sector takes the form of an infinitely large apartment complex that varies greatly in design between different concrete rooms, but the structure is always similar. The door always opens into afront lobby, which if exited, makes
			the door dissapear and the sector unexitable. 
		</p><p>
			Occasionally, the sky will begin to flicker from day to night rapidly and sporadically. This anomaly has been reported to last anywhere from half a second to 37 hours. Afterwards it can sometimes stay night for anywhere from a few minutes to a couple hours.
			Its advised that during a <em>flickering</em> you run to an apartment <em>immediately</em>
