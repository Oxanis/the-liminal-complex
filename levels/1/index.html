			<em>Level 1</em> takes the form of infinite fields with the occasional tree and hedge row. The level is mostly flat, and the grass is mostly green but has been reported to sometimes be yellow, and even more rearely, other colors such as pink, blue or red.
			The sky is a contant blue with some clouds, though the clouds are seemingly infinitely high in the air as they cannot be reached. The sky appears to be absent of the sun moon, and stars, but shadows still appear as if the sun was there and it was somewhat
			early in the day.
		</p><p>
			Throughout the level, there will rarely be small concrete structures, often run-down and not ergonomically designed. Doors with graffiti are affixed to the structure and when opened, revealing a seperate sector of the level that should <em>never be
			entered unless necessary.</em> This sector takes the form of an infinitely large apartment complex that varies greatly in design between different rooms, but the structure is always similar. The door always opens into a front lobby, which if exited, 
			makes the door dissapear and the sector unexitable. The structure of the sector is mazelike, winding with many unlabeled rooms devoid of furniture and resources. It is for this reason most <em>Level 1</em> deaths occur when someone wanders into an
			apartment complex. <em>NEVER GO TO DEEP INTO AN APARTMENT COMPLEX IN LEVEL 1.</em> Entities, however are absent from this sector, and if you are <em>very</em> lucky, you can find an entrance to <a href="/levels/0"><em>Level 0.</em></a>
		</p><p>
			Occasionally, the sky will begin to flicker from day to night rapidly and sporadically. This anomaly has been reported to last anywhere from half a second to 37 hours. Afterwards it can sometimes stay night for anywhere from a few minutes to a couple hours.
			Its advised that during a <em>flickering</em> you run to an apartment <em>immediately,</em> as no entities have ever been reported to enter an apartment complex.
		</p>
		</p>
		<h3>ENTRANCES</h3>
		<p>
			The most famous entrance to <em>Level 1</em> is through <a href="/levels/0"><em>Level 0,</em></a> if you ascend approximately 300m from your starting location.
		</p>
		<h3>EXITS</h3>
		<p>
			There is currently only 1 <em>listed</em> exit from <em>Level 1,</em> you can find an out of place staircase that looks similar to the stairs in <a href="/levels/0"><em>Level 0,</em></a> and if you climb them you will get transported there.
