		<p>
			<em>Level 9</em> is one of the many levels in <em>The Complex</em> that has an outdoor setting, specifically at night. The level consists of an expansive car park outside a handful of shops, and is somewhat safe to explore. Houses and other buildings can be seen in the distance, but they are unaccessible
			due to the ever-expanding nature of the level. The streetlights are known to cause severe hallucinations and is the main source of insanity and even deaths in this level. Most wanderers believe that this is the safest level due to it having more resources than most levels and is easy to access from early
			levels, however this is far from the case. Entities are known to prey on those who have been experiencing hallucinations for an extended period of time, as they would assume that they are merely hallucinating again - the main way to counter this is to stay looking away from the lights, you will not have
			hallucinations and therefore be more aware of your surroundings.
		</p><p>
			<em>Level 9</em> is more plentiful in terms of resources, and you can find food, water, and other supplies within uninhabited vehicles. Some wanderers choose to use the vehicles as homes, and may get aggressive if you attempt to take their resources, so you must stay cautious. Entering <em>Level 9</em> as
			a group is quite difficult as all wanderers start at a random location within the level.
		</p><p>
			<em>Level 9</em> has an abundance of entrances and exits, and could be considered as one of the "hubs" of <em>The Complex.</em> However, most exits are located within the shops, which are known to be the main residences of many entities.
		</p>
		<h3>ENTRANCES</h3>
		<p>
			There is currently only 1 listed entrance. Walking through a glass door that says <em>"Thank you for coming!"</em> over it in <a href="/levels/2"><em>Level 2</em></a> will take you to <em>Level 9,</em> and is also the only way to enter the level as a
			group, though is still sometimes unreliable.
		</p>
		<h3>EXITS</h3>
		<p>
			There is currently only 1 listed exit from <em>Level 9.</em> Although catastrophically rare, you can find a building that advertises a play area inside of it and walk in to get to <a href="/levels/2"><em>Level 2.</em></a> This has almost never been
			found by chance, the only method to reliably find it is to retrace your steps if you entered <em>Level 9</em> from <a href="/levels/2"><em>Level 2.</em></a>
