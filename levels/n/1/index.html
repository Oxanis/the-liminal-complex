            <em>Level -1</em> is the first of the negative levels of <em>The Complex</em> that most people find. At first, it appears to simply be a normal steel elevator, having a panel of buttons that light up when pressed, a steel handrail around the edges, and a mirror at the back. However, the buttons do not appear to be connected to anything, as removal of the panel simply shows another panel, but one where the numbers are jumbled and strange. The elevator has a door, however after about a minute, it disapears when no longer observed. In its place is another mirror, and this trend continues with other walls until there are no regular walls left, even removing the pannels. The original mirror shows a reflection of you, yet the ones that appear do not. The new mirrors are reflective of the elevator, yet not people. The new mirrors can be climed through, becoming a "mirror corridor" which no longer reflects, taking you into another elevator identical to the last exept for the side mirrors, which may become a door, or show one further down the mirror corridor.
