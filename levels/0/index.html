		<h1>Level 0</h1>
		<h2>CLASS 1 DIFFICULTY</h2>
		<p><em>- Sparse resources</em></p><p></p>
		<p><em>- Devoid of entities</em></p>
		<p><em>- Simple to exit</em></p>
		<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

			<em>Level 0</em> is the first level people who enter <em>The Complex</em> encounter. It takes the form of an infinitely expansive set of 1900s-styled stairs and hallways. Paintings litter the walls, however seem to have no signature and are often blank
			or depict strange, abstract, and sometimes unsettling things. Wanderers report paintings that depict people/entities have their gaze follow you, however this has only been reported in mentally unstable cases and thus it is unclear whether this is
			truly a product of the level, or of the wanderer's own mind playing tricks on them. The wallpaper is often ornate but can vary between parts of the level, staying mostly the same color. The carpet's pattern never changes, however, and stairs have
			markings on the end used on earth to assist the visually impaired. The wood used for the banisters remains unidentified, and any attempts to destroy or alter parts of the level have been fruitless.
			The level winds constantly, making it hard to see more than a couple dozen metres ahead and navigation difficult. The level is also known to shift whilst wanderers aren't around, and shifted rooms often are lost forever, so
			<em>NEVER LEAVE YOUR BELONGINGS WHERE YOU CANT SEE THEM IN LEVEL 0.</em>
		</p><p>
			Due to <em>Level 0</em> being infinitely expansive,
			it is virtually impossible to find other wanderers unless you enter as a group. Although extensive logging and research show that no entities have been recorded to enter, or reside in <em>Level 0,</em> hallucinations such as talking, loud banging, or
			strange animalistic noises are far from rare in <em>Level 0.</em> If you do enter as a group, you don't want to be split up because of the level's shifting, so keep an eye over <em>everyone</em> and <em>stick together.</em> The level makes wanderers
			go insane at a rapid rate compared to most levels, and so it is theorised not many people are able to make it out of <em>Level 0</em> alive when they enter <em>The Complex.</em>
		</p><p>
			<em>Level 0's</em> position in the complex is painfully important as it is one of the only reliable access points connecting the negative and positive levels. This is a problem for large groups hauling large amounts of supplies as you must all enter
			<em>together</em> and stay <em>together.</em> The level, however is safe, no deaths have been reported in the level aside from starvation/dehydration based ones.

		<h3>ENTRANCES</h3>
		<p>
			Thus far, there are only 4 recorded entrances to <em>Level 0,</em> one being from reality, if you find a staircase that goes on for far longer than it should, it will eventually transition into <em>The Complex.</em> If everyone who observes this anomaly
			looks away, it will be safe to climb the stairs again. Another is from any level, a door can randomly appear labeled "journey back", if you enter it, you will find yourself in level 0. The last is from both levels 1 and -1, if you find an out of place
			staircase resembling one from <em>Level 0,</em> its will take you back
		</p>
		<h3>EXITS</h3>
		<p>
			Only 2 Exits have been found so far, if you travel up around 1km from where you begin in <em>Level 0,</em> it will take you to <em>Level 1</em>, and if you traverse downwards for approximately 1km you reach <em>Level -1.</em>
