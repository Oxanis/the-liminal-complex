			<em>Level 0</em> is the first level people who enter the complex encounter. It takes the form of and infinitely expansive set of 1900s-styled stairs and hallways. The level winds constantly, making it hard to see more that a couple dozen metres ahead and
			navigation difficult. The level is also known to shift whilst wanderers aren't around, and shifted rooms often are lost forever, so <em>NEVER LEAVE YOUR THINGS WHERE YOU CANT SEE THEM IN LEVEL 0.</em> Due to <em>Level 0</em> being infinitely expansive,
			it is virtually impossible to find other wanderers unless you enter as a group.
