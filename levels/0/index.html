			<em>Level 0</em> is the first level people who enter the complex encounter. It takes the form of and infinitely expansive set of 1900s-styled stairs and hallways. Paintings litter the walls however seem to have no signature and are often blank
			or depict strange, abstract, and sometimes unsettling things. Wanderers report paintings that depict people/entities have their gaze follow you, however this has only been reported in mentally unstable cases and thus it is unclear whether this is
			truly a product of the level, or of the wanderer's own mind playing tricks on them. The wallpaper is often ornate but can vary between parts of the level, staying mostly the same color. The carpet's pattern never changes, however, and stairs have
			markings on the end used on earth to assist the visually impaired. The wood used for the banisters remains unidentified, and any attempts to destroy or alter parts of the level have been fruitless.
			The level winds constantly, making it hard to see more that a couple dozen metres ahead and navigation difficult. The level is also known to shift whilst wanderers aren't around, and shifted rooms often are lost forever, so
			<em>NEVER LEAVE YOUR BELONGINGS WHERE YOU CANT SEE THEM IN LEVEL 0.</em>
		</p><p>
			Due to <em>Level 0</em> being infinitely expansive,
			it is virtually impossible to find other wanderers unless you enter as a group. Although despite extensive logging and research, no entities have been recorded to enter, or reside in <em>Level 0,</em> hallucinations such as talking, loud banging, or
			strange animalistic noises are far from rare in <em>Level 0.</em> If you do enter as a group, you dont want to be split up because of the level's shifting, so keep an eye over <em>everyone</em> and <em>stick together.</em> The level makes wanderers
			go insane at a rapid rate compared to most levels, and so it is theorised not many people are able to make it out of level 0 alive when they enter the complex.
		</p><p>
			<em>Level 0's</em> postion in the complex is painfully important as it is one of the only reliable access points connecting the negative and positive levels. This is a problem for large groups hauling large amounts of supplies as you must all enter
			<em>together</em> and stay <em>together.</em> The level, however is safe, no deaths have been reported in the level aside from starvation/dehydration based ones.
