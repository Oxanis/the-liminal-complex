  <h1>The Complex Wiki</h1>
<p>
	<em>The Complex</em> is a seperate reality from earth, entered by climing an impossibly long flight of stairs. If you do this, you will find yourself in <a href="/levels/0"><em>Level 0,</em></a> with no way back home. Your only option is to attempt to survive,
	and if you get so lucky, <em>thrive</em> in the new environment. This wiki is an initiative started by the <a href="/groups/0"><em>Complex Reasearch and Mapping Project (C.R.M.P)</em></a> to ensure wanderers are educated so they may achieve these goals.
</p><p>This wiki contains four catergories. The Miscellaneous Archives are any entries that dont fit in any other categories.</p>
